# OmniTutor v2.9: The Hyper-Hub 🚀

OmniTutor is a next-generation **Knowledge Synthesis** platform designed to bridge the gap between AI conversation and long-term retention. By combining **Neural Hub** (conversational AI), **Knowledge Canvas** (persistence), and the **Quiz Engine** (validation), OmniTutor creates a closed-loop learning environment.

## 🌌 Core Architecture

### 1) Neural Hub (AI Interface)
- **Contextual Memory:** Automatically pulls context from your saved Canvas packets.
- **Document Focusing:** Pin a specific packet to force the AI to reason exclusively within that document’s boundaries.
- **LaTeX Integration:** Full rendering support for mathematical and scientific notation via MathJax.

### 2) Knowledge Canvas
- **Packet Persistence:** Save AI responses as permanent Knowledge Packets.
- **Focus Mode:** Toggle specific packets into the AI’s active attention window.
- **Micro-Learning:** Documents are kept concise to encourage rapid review and chunking of information.

### 3) Quiz Engine
- **Generative Assessment:** Uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to analyze your current Canvas and generate 3-question MCQ assessments.
- **Socratic Validation:** Tests your understanding of your own saved data to ensure active recall.

### 4) Neural Mind Map
- **Spatial Relationship:** Visualizes your knowledge ecosystem as a constellation.
- **Dynamic Growth:** The map expands automatically as you pin more packets to the Canvas.

## 🛠 Setup & Synchronization
- **API Key:** Obtain a Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.
- **Config Node:** Navigate to Settings in the sidebar and enter your key.
- **ProCode:** Use the built-in ProCode editor for drafting scripts or prototyping alongside your tutor.

## 🗺 Future Roadmap (v3.0 and Beyond)

We are actively developing the following **Hyper-Sync** features:

### 🎙 Audio Synthesis (OmniVoice)
- **Neural Lectures:** Convert your Knowledge Canvas into a podcast-style audio lecture.
- **Voice Interactivity:** Ask questions using voice-to-text and receive spoken explanations.

### 🖼 Vision Integration
- **Diagram Interpretation:** Upload images of handwritten notes or complex diagrams for the AI to convert into Canvas packets.
- **Automatic Infographics:** Generate SVG diagrams directly from text-based knowledge packets.

### 👥 Collaborative Portals
- **Shared Hubs:** Create a public Hub ID to share your Knowledge Canvas with peers.
- **Group Quizzing:** Real-time competitive assessments based on shared study materials.

### 📈 Predictive Analytics
- **Retention Tracking:** The system will track quiz performance to identify weak nodes in your mind map.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Automatic reminders to review specific packets before you are likely to forget them.

## 📜 Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome.
- **Intelligence:** Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash).
- **Rendering:** MathJax (LaTeX), SVG (Mind Mapping).
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage (in-memory browser state).
